# Mike's OpenGL Sandbox

Purpose of this demo is showcasing 3D real-time techniques I gradually implement while studying OpenGL and CG in general. This is a "living" project, in a sense that it is going to be changed often.

Features implemented so far:
- Basic OBJ importer
- Simple Scene class
- Mesh object (taking care of allocating VAO, VBO and EBO)
- A scene showcasing 3D import, UV mapping and model outlining through Stencil and Depth buffers
- A scene showcasing basic post-process shaders
- A scene showcasing an implementation of light shafts (Godrays)
- Skybox
- Shaders class
- Heightmap-based Terrain with textures interpolation
